Hydra
=======================================================

About
-----

Hydra is a robust project template which uses Django 4 on the backend and HTMX, AlpineJS, and Tailwind on the frontend.

This combination of technologies means:

- You'll spend less time writing custom Javascript
- Keep frontend code near the locality of behavior
- You'll leverage the strengths of both Django and concise templates to render content quickly and easily
- You'll be easily able to extend this template for customized use cases
- But perhaps the best thing about Hydra is that once you're familiar with it, *it's just fun to use*!
